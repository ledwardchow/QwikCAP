# QwikCAP
VPN-based direct proxy forwarding for iOS traffic.

This was a mostly a weekend Claude Opus 4.5 experiment, so please excuse the slop, hah! 

## Features/Use Case
QwikCAP creates a local VPN connection on your iOS device, configurable via the app to forward traffic to a specified HTTP proxy address. A proxy exception hostname list is configurable.

If you are:
* Troubleshooting a mobile application as a developer and need to see the HTTP traffic it's sending
* A pentester

and you have been manually hosting a PAC file, fiddling with proxy settings in your wifi connection profile and wish there was a better way - this app is for you!

## Bugs/Issues
Please use the Github issue ticketing system to report bugs! (Or fix it yourself/ask Claude to do it and send a pull request!) 

## Privacy Policy
If you arrived here from the App Store - this app collects no data from you, and there is analytics functionality present. The only network traffic this app is coded to send is the traffic to your proxy as part of core functionality.
